= OST Wallet UI Content Config

App developers can configure the text shown on various views displayed by OstWalletUI.

To configure the content, the sdk needs to be provided with https://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/JSONObject[`JSON`].

The default configuration can be found link:../ostsdk/src/main/assets/ost-content-config.json[here].

== Dictionary Data Structure

Here is the small sample `json` representation of the configuration.

[source,js]
----
{
  "activate_user": {
    "create_pin": {
      "title_label": {
        "text": "Activate Your Wallet"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

In the above example:

* The first-level key `activate_user` corresponds to `Activate User` workflow.
* The second-level key `create_pin` corresponds to `Create Pin` view.
* The third-level key `title_label` corresponds to label that displays the title of the view.
* The fourth-level key `text` is corresponds to diplay text to the title label.
