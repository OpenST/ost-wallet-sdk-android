=== Set Theme Config

Theme for OstWalletUI can be initialized by calling `setThemeConfig` API, which setup OstWalletUI theme config

*Parameters* + &nbsp;__themeConfig: Config to use for UI__ +

theme-config.json

[source,json]
----
{
  "nav_bar_logo_image": {
    "asset_name": "nav_bar_logo"
  }
}
----

Change "nav_bar_logo" with your drawable file name in resource folder, which you want to show in navigation bar.

[source,java]
